# Simple-Banking-System
A simple banking system implementation in Python. It is a console-based application that simulates a banking system where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view their balance. The project involves working with SQL databases, implementing the Luhn algorithm for validating credit card numbers, and using object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
